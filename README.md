# archive-page-overrides
A lightweight plugin which extends WordPress' Settings > Reading page to allow CMS pages to take the place of core WordPress functionality; Search pages, 404 pages and post type archive pages. This is most useful when using things like ACF's Flexible Content to allow for modular pages.

Bedrock compatible.
